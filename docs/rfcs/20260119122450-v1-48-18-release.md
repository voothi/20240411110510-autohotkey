# RFC: Release v1.48.18 - TTS Migration and Ukrainian Support

## Staging
ZID: 20260119122450

## Implementation Details

### Analytics
This release consolidates the transition of the Text-to-Speech system from the legacy Piper TTS wrapper to the modern `anki-tts-cli`. The change was prompted by the need for a more integrated CLI that handles both translation and synthesis efficiently. Additionally, the user base required support for the Ukrainian language.

### Decisions
1.  **Version Bump**: Formally tagging the workspace changes as `v1.48.18`.
2.  **Consolidate TTS Changes**: Included the migration to `anki-tts-cli.py` and the new positional argument structure.
3.  **UI/Hotkey Update**: Finalized the addition of `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+5` for Ukrainian speech synthesis.
4.  **Documentation Sync**: Ensured `README.md` and `release-notes.md` accurately reflect the new dependencies and hotkeys.
