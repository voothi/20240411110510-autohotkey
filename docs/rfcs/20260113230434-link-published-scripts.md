# Link Published Draft Scripts

## Implementation Details

The user has published several draft scripts related to translation and TTS.
These repositories should be linked in the documentation and relevant scripts.

### Repositories
- https://github.com/voothi/20241122093311-deep-translator
- https://github.com/voothi/20241121100211-argotranslate

- https://github.com/voothi/20250214181911-lingva-translate-cli

### Plan
1.  Update `README.md` to include these links in a relevant section (e.g., "Related Projects" or "Dependencies" or "Tools used").
2.  Update `release-notes.md` to mention the documentation update.
3.  Check `translate-selection/translate-selection.ahk` and `tts.ahk` to see if comments or documentation strings should be updated.
